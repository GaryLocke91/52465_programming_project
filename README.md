### Problem statement

For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish - you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the ```numpy.random``` package for this purpose. Specifically, in this project you should:

* Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.

* Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.

* Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

* Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook - the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

### Executing the Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook can be installed either from the [main website](https://jupyter.org/) or as part of the [Anaconda Open Source Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Jupyter is a Python package designed to make it easier to interact with Python.

1. Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, download the notebook to a folder on your computer.

2. Open the command line and browse to the folder the notebook was downloaded to using the ```cd``` command to change directory.

3. Type ```jupyter notebook``` and press ENTER.

4. It automatically opens a tab in your default browser.

5. Click on *52446_programming_project.ipynb* to open the notebook.

To run a code cell in the notebook, click onto the cell, hold down the CTRL key and press ENTER.
